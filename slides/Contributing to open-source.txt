What’s open-source

Write code
	your own projects
	host online: GitHub, Bitbucket, etc.
	choose license: http://choosealicense.com/


JUST DO IT.

Don’t write code
Goal:

Write as little code as possible.

Don’t write code
Find open-source code that does what you want.

You can always refactor later.

Finding good code is a skill.
